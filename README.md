# Brain-Tumor-Detection

Sometimes identifying a brain tumour in its early stages can be challenging for doctors and requires very high level of accuracy and detection. Using a dataset provided by Kaggle, I managed to make 3 neural network models (VGG-19, VGG-16 & InceptionV3) to help doctors identify tumours fasters and at an early stage. The model is then deployed using streamlit making a minimalistic web application.
